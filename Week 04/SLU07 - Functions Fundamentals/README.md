# Small Learning Unit 07 - Functions: Fundamentals

## What is this Learning Unit (LU) about? ðŸ‘€

As its topic suggests, in this LU you'll get your first exposure to the most fundamental and powerful tool common to all programming languages: FUNCTIONS! 

You'll be introduced to how these are built but by no means will you become an expert in them and that's okay. It takes years to master the composition of functions in each programming language.


**If there is one takeaway from this LU, it should be:**

### Avoid repeating code by using functions ðŸ§ 

Instead of reapeating code every time you need to use it, you should refactor the code into a function and call that function instead. Refactoring consists on improving the structure of the code, while preserving its goal and behaviour - a very important definition for a programmer stack ðŸ¤“

That's it. Really. The most common and severe mistake that programmers make is to copy-paste the same code into multiple places rather than converting it into a function. It takes a bit of extra brainpower but, in the end, it always saves more time than it takes. Even though Jupyter notebooks are not that friendly to functions (other IDEs have a lot of automated help when creating functions) let's try and give our best effort in using them! ðŸ’ª

## How to go through this SLU
You are probably already familiar with the process but in case you aren't these are the steps for this LU:

1. Follow the [Learning Unit Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2021#2-learning-unit-workflow) to set up your environment.
2. Go through the Learning Notebook.
3. Do the Exercise notebook, and submit it, as usual.
