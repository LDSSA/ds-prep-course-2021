# SLU08: Functions - Intermediate

Now that you've got the basics regarding functions, let's take a look at a few ways in which they can be implemented and used. Since functions are all about allowing us to organize our code, knowing the different ways they can be used gives us a totally new set of superpowers.


### Keyword arguments

Keyword arguments, or kwargs, give you a new way to style your function inputs. With keyword arguments you get a few nice things:

- Help the user of your function by providing default values to arguments
- Make function calling easier to read


### Scope

Scope is all about understanding how variables inside and outside of a function differ. It is absolutely fundamental to understand scope when working with Jupyter Notebooks as it will save you sooooooooo many debugging sessions in the future.


### Built-in functions

Python already has some integrated functions by default that, despite being non-editable, they are available for us to use! We will go through some of the most used built-in functions.


### Best practices

When writing a program or a script, how should you use functions? How can you document all the functions and code that you are writing so that they can easily be used and understood by any potential user. This is useful even for yourself, as programmers easily forget all the details of a function after some time has passed.


## How to go through this SLU
You probably are already pretty familiar with the process but in case you aren't these are the steps for this LU:

1. Follow the Learning Unit Workflow to setup your environment.
2. Go through the Learning Notebook.
3. Do the Exercise notebook, and submit it, as usual.
