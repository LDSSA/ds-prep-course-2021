# SLU12 - Linear Algebra & NumPy, Part 1

In this unit you'll be introduced to Linear Algebra, a key subject for data scientists. You'll learn how you can handle matrices and vectors, their main properties and basic operations, the intuitions behind the "linear" in Linear Algebra, and how to apply basic matrix operations using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (v1.20.0), the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. You'll learn how to create numpy arrays, understand their shape and dimension, how to subset rows and columns in matrices (2D arrays), use boolean indexing and perform concatenation.

> ⚠️ There are __2 Learning Notebooks__ in this unit. Begin with ___"Learning Notebook 1"___ first, the contents are sequential.

**By the end of SLU 12 (Week 07) and SLU13 (Week 08) you will master the basics of:**

- Scalar multiplication, addition and multiplication of vectors and matrices, matrix inverse, and their properties;
- The intuition behind concepts such as linear combinations and linear independence;
- Systems of linear equations, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.
- How to apply all of this magic in Python using a library called [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).
