# Small Learning Unit 01 - Programming Basics

## What is in this SLU?

In this Learning Unit, you'll be introduced to the world of Python programming. You'll start by learning what programming is and where to look for additional materials.
You'll then learn about the `print()` function and how you can use it to your advantage. You'll also see how to comment your code to improve readability.

Then the interesting part: using basic data and operations. You'll see how to use several data types and the respective operations to manipulate data and obtain the results that you want. You'll be introduced to the concept of *operator precedence*.

Last but definitely not the least, you'll store the results of your calculations inside variables for later use.

Hope that you enjoy the ride and have fun.

#### Main topics

- `print()` function
- Comments
- Basic data types
- Operators and their precedence
