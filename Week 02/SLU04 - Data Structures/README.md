# Small Learning Unit 04 - Data Structures

## What is in this SLU?

A Data Structure is a collection of data values that enables data organization, management, and storage. Different tasks and algorithms call for different data structures that could be more efficient for a specific application (e.g. faster access, easier manipulation). 

This learning unit covers theory and practical exercises regarding four types of data structures in Python: tuples, lists, dictionaries and sets.   

#### Main topics

- Tuple
- List
- Dictionary
- Set
