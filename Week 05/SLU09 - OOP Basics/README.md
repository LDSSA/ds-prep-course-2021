# SLU09 - OOP Basics 

Objects are a fascinating part of Python, and will allow you to build powerful things, while keeping complexity manageable. 
In this SLU you will learn the basics of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 

Be warned, this topic can feel tricky at first, so expect to take some time on this one. 
This SLU will probably take you between 6 and 10 hours. Make yourself a nice cup of tea. 

We have broken the Learning Notebooks into 3 different parts. When you finish notebook 1, we suggest you go to the first exercises, and get some practice immediately. If you don't and just keep reading, it will probably start getting a bit too abstract. 
Also, remember that your Learning Notebooks are editable too, so don't be afraid to open new cells and try stuff out. The best way to learn objects it to play with objects. Mess around, see what happens, and get comfortable with them! 

Finally, the exercises will start easy, but the last 2 are quite difficult. This is deliberate, as we wanted to make sure that you understood the concept enough to learn the next SLU, and also to pass theÂ OOP question of Academy entrance test. 

Don't get discouraged if it feels difficult. This is serious programming stuff now :)
