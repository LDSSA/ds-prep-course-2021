## **1. Initial Setup**


By completing this you will setup and learn about all the tools you'll be
using during the academy. Don't worry if you can't figure out what some of the the commands you will use do. 
Anything that is important will be explained in more detail during the course.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: You should complete this setup by April 5, as the course will begin on that day. If you are struggling to install any of the software mentioned below, tell us ASAP!

üìù Once you complete the setup mark yourself as completed (Yes) on #TODO [this spreadsheet](???).

<br>

### **1.1(a) Windows Setup**

This section deals with setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows 10.
If you are using MacOS or Linux, skip this section ([go to MacOS Setup](#11b-macos-setup)).

<br>

>**Why do I need to install WSL?**
>
> Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) enables you to run Linux command lines inside Windows. All of our setup instructions and learning materials are created for Mac OS/Linux, so we will not be able to provide support on how to do it on Windows.  
 

If you have some doubts/worries, feel free to reach out to us.

<br>

**Windows 10 Setup**

Follow **[this guide](guides/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux_Installation_Guide_for_Windows_10.md)** if you are running Windows 10.

<br>

### **1.1(b) MacOS Setup**

Some of the steps in the following sections will require _Homebrew_ for MacOS.
_Homebrew_ will make it easier to install software that we'll use later on.  

**Step 1:** To open the terminal, choose one:
* In Finder <img src='assets/finder.png' alt='Finder' width="2%" />, open the /Applications/Utilities folder, then double-click Terminal.
* By pressing <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> then type `terminal` and press <kbd>enter</kbd>.

    The terminal should now be open:

    <img src='assets/mac_terminal.png' width="50%" />

<br>

**Step 2:** Copy and paste the following line in the terminal:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
    ```
    You may be prompted to install the _Command Line Developers Tools_. Confirm and, once it finishes, continue installing _Homebrew_ by pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> again.

<br>

### **1.2 Setup _Git_ and _GitHub_**

**Git** is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source  code. A **repository** is where code lives, and the code from the prep course will live at [`ds-prep-course-2021`](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2021) repository. This is where the learning materials and exercises will be released (made available).

**Step 1:** Install Git

(a) Under **Ubuntu**, open an Ubuntu terminal and run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt install git
```

(b) Under **MacOS**, open a terminal and run the following command:
```bash
brew install git
```
<br>

**Step 2:** Create a _GitHub_ account

[Sign up](https://github.com/join) for a _GitHub_ account and follow the instructions.

<br>

### **1.3 Setup your Workspace Repository**

The workspace directory/repository is where you will place everything you
are working on, where you will make changes to files, write code, etc.

<br>

#### **1.3.1 Creating the Workspace**

<br>

**Step 1:** Log into _GitHub_

**Step 2:** In the upper-right corner of the page, click the "+" button and select `New repository`:

![Create Repository](assets/menu_create_repository.png "Create Repository")

**Step 3:** Create a new **private** repository called *ds-prep-workspace*. 

1. You need to explicitly select Private - This is your private work environment. 

1. Initialize with a README. 

1. Add a Python `.gitignore`.

![Create Repository](assets/create_repository.png "Create Repository")

You can also check
[Creating a new repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-new-repository) on GitHub for help.

<br>

#### **1.3.2 Cloning the Workspace**

<br>

**Step 1:** Open a terminal (or use one you've already opened)

**Step 2:** Create a folder named `projects` by using the `mkdir` command:
```bash
mkdir ~/projects
```

**Step 3:** Enter the folder by using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd ~/projects
```

**Step 3:** You can now **clone** the `ds-prep-workspace` repository you created on GitHub by using the `git clone` command:

 _**Note:** Replace `<username>` below with your github username._

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/ds-prep-workspace.git
```

**Step 4:** You'll be asked for your git username. Type it and press <kbd>enter</kbd>. Then you'll be asked for your git password. Type it and press <kbd>enter</kbd>

You should now have a local copy of your `ds-prep-workspace` in your `~/projects/ds-prep-workspace` folder.

<br>

_By August 13, 2021, the username+password authentication [will no longer be supported](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/)._

<br>

### **1.4 Clone the `ds-prep-course-2021` repository**

<br>


Let's clone the [`ds-prep-course-2021`](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2021) repository, [just like we did](#132-cloning-the-workspace) for `ds-prep-workspace`. This is where all of the learning materials will be made available, as the academy progresses.

**Step 1:** Open a terminal (or use one you've already opened) and enter the `projects` folder:
```bash
cd ~/projects
```

**Step 2:** Clone the Prep Course repository (it's the same that contains the README you're reading right now!):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2021.git
```

‚ö†Ô∏è You only need to clone a repository **once**, so you won't need to repeat these steps during the course!

<br>

### **1.5 Installing Python 3.7 and all necessary packages**

<br>

#### **1.5.1(a) Set up Python 3.7 in Ubuntu**

<br>

**Step 1:** Open an Ubuntu terminal and check what version of Python you have:

```bash
python3 --version
```

**Step 2:** If your version is not `Python 3.7.x` (`x` = any number), run the following to install **Python 3.7**:

```bash
#TODO - install steps Python 3.7
```

**Step 3** Run the following command to get `pip` and `venv`:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv
```
**Why do we install these?**
- we'll be using `pip` which is the reference Python package manager;
- you should always use a virtual environment to install python packages. We'll use `venv` to set them up.

<br>

#### **1.5.1(b) Set up Python 3.7 in Mac OS**

<br>

If you are using **Mac OS** you will need to install python, this can be done in a terminal by running:
```bash
brew install python
#TODO - Install Python 3.7 and setup packages in Mac OS
```

### **1.6 Testing the workflow**
Finally, test the workflow ([next section](#2-learning-unit-workflow)) on `"Week 0"`. After that you'll be officially ready to start the course!


<br>

## 2. Learning Unit Workflow

**Each week** a new folder will be released on the [`ds-prep-course-2021`](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2021) repository. For example, on Week 1 (April 5 - April 11), the folder containing the learning units will be called `"Week 1"`. The releases will be announced on Slack, on the ___#announcements___ channel.

üìù _You will need to follow the workflow (steps) described in this section **every** week_

Once a new Learning Unit is available at the beginning of each week, do the following:


**Step 1 -** Pull the changes from the 
[ds-prep-course-2021](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2021) repo:
    
```bash
cd ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2021/
git pull
```

* **Note:** the `git pull` command downloads all the new contents/changes on the remote repository to your local copy.

**Step 2 -** Copy the Week folder with the Learning Units to your local `ds-prep-workspace`:

```bash
cp -r ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2021/"Week <week number>" ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace/
``` 
* Replace `"Week <week number>"` by the appropriate folder name. Example: for Week 0 we would write `"Week 0"`

**Setting up the virtual environment**

We will be using the same virtual environment throughout the course - we'll name it `prep-venv`.

**Step 3:** Activate the environment:
```bash
source ~/.virtualenvs/prep-venv/bin/activate
```

- Install the python packages from `requirements.txt` **for each learning unit** (there are multiple learning units (SLU's) in a Week!)
    ```bash
    pip install -r ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace/"Week <week number>"/"<SLU name>"/requirements.txt
    ```
    and you would replace `<week number>` and `<SLU name>`, such that in Week 0 and SLU000 - Jupyter Notebook, for example, the command would be:
    ```bash
    pip install -r ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace/"Week 0"/"SLU000 - Jupyter Notebook"/requirements.txt
    ```
1. Change to the `ds-prep-workspace` dir
    ```bash
    cd ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace
    ```
1. Open Jupyter Notebook
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
1. Work
1. Once all tests pass or once you're happy, save your work, close the browser tab with the Jupyter Notebook, close the terminal and open a new terminal
1. Then commit the changes and push
    ```bash
    cd ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace
    git add .
    git commit -m "Work on week <week number> exercises"
    git push
    ```
1. Profit

## 3. Updates to Learning Units

As much as we try and have processes in place to prevent errors and bugs in 
the learning units some make it through to you.
If the problem is not in the exercise notebook you can just pull the new 
version from the `ds-prep-course-2021` repo and replace the file on your ds-prep-workspace.
The problem is if the correction is in the exercise notebook, you can't just
replace the file because your work is there and you'll lose it!

When a new version of the exercise notebook is released (and announced) you will have to merge the work you've already done into the new version of the
notebook.

At the moment our suggestion to merge the changes is: 
1. Rename the old version
1. Copy the new exercise notebook over
1. Open both and copy paste your solutions to the new notebook

We understand it's not ideal and are working on improving this workflow.

## 4. Help

### 4.1 How to ask for help

During the prep-course you will surely run into problems and have doubts about the
material.
Please refer to [this wiki page](https://github.com/LDSSA/wiki/wiki/Data-Science-Prep-Course#how-to-ask-for-help) on how to ask for help!

### 4.2 Troubleshooting

#### When I open Windows Explorer through Ubuntu, it goes to a different folder than in the guide

* Please make sure:
    * you are running the command `explorer.exe .` including the dot at the end.
    * you are running Windows 10 version `1909` or newer.

#### Ubuntu on Windows 10 high CPU usage, crashes

* First please make sure you are running Windows 10 version `1909` or newer.
* Then, try following [these steps](https://teckangaroo.com/enable-windows-10-virtual-machine-platform/)

#### When I pull from the `ds-prep-course-2021` repository, I get the error:

```
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:  
<some files>
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
Aborting
```

_git_ is telling us that changes were made by you to the files on the `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2021` folder, and is not pulling the changes made by the instructors because they would override the changes that you made there. To fix this do the following:
1. make sure that any change you made to the files on `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2021`  (that you want to not lose) is saved in your `~/projects/ds-prep-workspace` repository (see https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2021#updates-to-learning-units for how to do this), and if you don't want to keep the changes you made to these files, just continue on to the next step
2. go to the `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2021` folder and run: 

    ```
    cd ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2021
    git stash
    ```

3. now you can pull from the `ds-prep-course-2021` repository:

    ```
    git pull
    ```

#### When I try to open `jupyter notebook`, I get the error:

```
migs-MBP% jupyter notebook
zsh: command not found: jupyter
```

Before opening `jupyter notebook` activate your virtual environment:

```
source ~/.virtualenvs/prep-venv/bin/activate
```

#### When I use the `cp` command the `>` sign appears and the command does not execute

```
cp -r ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2021/‚ÄúWeek 0" ds-prep-workspace
>
```

Make sure to use this type of quotes `"` and not these ones `‚Äú`.

#### My problem is not listed here, what should I do?
