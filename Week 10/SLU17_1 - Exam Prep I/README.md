# SLU17_1 - Exam Prep I

This learning unit is all about the previous exams.

Each SLU17_X contains one exercise notebook with questions from the previous LDSSA entry exams.

You can solve the exam just like the exercise notebooks from the previous SLUs, with the exception that you **shouldn't** submit it to the Portal.

It would be adviceable to set some distraction-free time (~2h) and do the exercises like if it would be the entry exam.

Happy testing!
