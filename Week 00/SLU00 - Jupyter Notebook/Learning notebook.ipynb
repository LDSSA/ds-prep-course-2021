Reselect the cell (by clicking on it) and click on \"Run\" in the Toolbar to see it being updated to [2].\n",

    "## Notebook Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook kernel is a “computational engine” that executes the code contained in the jupyter notebook document. \n",
    "Since you choose to create the notebook with Python 3, the kernel executes Python code. There are kernels for other languages but in the prep course and in the academy, we will only be using Python 3.\n",
    "When you open a jupyter notebook document, the associated kernel is automatically launched. When the notebook is executed, the kernel performs the computation and produces the results. Depending on the type of computations, the kernel may consume significant CPU and RAM. However, for the prep course and the academy, you should be more than fine with 8GB of RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what does this have to do with restarting the notebook before running all cells? We'll almost there! Look at this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"1000\" src=\"https://imgur.com/BE6TnC3.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of the example, just imagine that I'm storing the value 1 in a variable named a, the value 2 in a variable named b and the value 3 in a variable named c. And in the end, I'm printing them. It's straightforward, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine that for some reason I later decide that I don't want to store the value 2 in variable b, in fact, I don't want to create a variable b after all. So, I delete that cell (you can do the same by clicking Edit in the Menu bar and then \"Delete Cells\". Next to it is an option \"Undo Delete Cells\" incase you delete the wrong cell). I then decide to run all cells again. This is what I would get: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"1000\" src=\"https://imgur.com/SYtvudV.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks strange right? There is no b being defined in my notebook, but it seems that the notebook somehow \"remembers\" that b used to store the value 2. Let's go ahead and print only b:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"1000\" src=\"https://imgur.com/kmQ4OCQ.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our suspicions are true! The lesson here is that the jupyter kernel stored the information \"b = 2\" in memory and deleting the cell that previously had this instruction **does not** erase this information from memory. So, if we really don't want this information to be stored in memory, what could we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "As I've told you before, this is why I restart the notebook before running all cells. Restarting the notebook will erase everything from the kernel memory and when you run all cells again **only** the current code cells will be considered. \n",
    "Let's try this! On the Menu bar click in \"Kernel\" and then in \"Restart & Run All\". You should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"1000\" src=\"https://imgur.com/a9i44nG.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we have an error saying that \"b\" is not defined, which sounds about right since \"b\" is not defined anywhere in our notebook! This may seem like a simple detail and I'm sure some of you are thinking \"this is stupid and I would never do this\" but trust me: along the prep course or the academy this is a very common mistake to do and you can end up spending a lot of time in bugs that will trace back to this issue. Apply these concepts in the cells below (remember that to delete a cell you need to click Edit in the Menu bar and then \"Delete Cells\"):"

    "Using the keyboard arrows \"up\" and \"down\" you can select different cells in your notebook. In editing mode, typing \"a\" will insert a cell above the cell that you're selecting and typing \"b\" will insert a cell below the cell that you're selecting. Typing \"d\" two times in fast succession will delete the cell that you're selecting.\n",

They can be used to teach concepts (as I've been doing in this notebook) but during the academy I mostly used them to store information that was too important to go into a comment. Try it for yourself: change the cell below to markdown and copy paste the following text:\n",

In edit mode, there are two shortcuts that also come in handy, the first one is \"shift\"+\"enter\", it will run the current cell and also create a new cell under it, so that you can easily continue coding. The other one is \"ctrl\"+\"enter\" which will just run the current cell. Both will save you a lot of clicks in Toolbar! \n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, my most used command \"Restart & Run All\" doesn't have a shortcut. What I've done, since I was using it so many times, was defining it myself. You can do that as well (and remember that this is just a personal tip) by clicking \"Help\" in the Menu bar, selecting \"Edit Keyboard Shortcuts\", search for the \"restart kernel and run all cells\" command and type \"Ctrl-R\" in the \"add shortcut\" field and then clicking \"OK\" in the bottom right corner of the window. This way you can just click in \"ctrl\"+\"R\" instead of doing it the manual way.\n",
