## Welcome to SLU10 - OOP Inheritance

The main goal for this Learning Unit is to further develop your Python Class knowledge, studying the following topics:
- Parent Class
- Child Class
- Inheritance
- Overriding
- `Isinstance` function

Keep in mind that this is only a fraction of the existing material on Python Object Oriented Programming. 
So, if you have the time, it is always important to keep on exploring this language. For sure you won't regret it. :)

Here is the link for the official Python documentation on classes (thus on inheritance), although with a more technical approach it has literally everything:
