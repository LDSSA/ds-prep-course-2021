<br>

## On WSL with Ubuntu:
Enter the `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2021` directory using the `cd` command, then run `explorer.exe .` **(don't forget to include the dot! the dot means "current directory")** to open Windows explorer in the current directory:

```bash
cd ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2021
explorer.exe .
```

Windows Explorer should pop up now:

![Sample learning unit](assets/week_0.png "Sample learning unit")


<br>

## On Mac:
In Finder <img src='assets/finder.png' alt='Finder' width="4%" height="4%"/>, open the "Go" menu, choose the option "Go to folder..."

<img src='assets/go_to_folder.png' alt='Sample learning unit' width="70%"/>


<br>

Now just paste the path to the `ds-prep-course-2021` repository: `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2021`, then click "Go".

<img src='assets/finder_go.png' alt='Sample learning unit' width="90%"/>
