After you're done installing those updates, please [check which version of Windows 10 you are running](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running), and if your version number is smaller that `1909`, then please keep coming back to Windows Update and installing updates untill you have at least version `1909`. Then you may proceed with the guide.

## Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux

Before installing any Linux distros for WSL, you must ensure that the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" optional feature is enabled:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator by typing "PowerShell" in your Windows search bar 

![start](assets/start.png)

and then clicking "Run as Administrator"

![start](assets/open_powershell.png)

2. Then paste the following command on PowerShell 

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

![start](assets/paste_powershell.png)

and run it by pressing <kbd>enter</kbd>:
    

3. Restart your computer if asked to.

## Install your Linux Distribution of Choice

1. Open the this link to the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N9TNGVNDL3Q) and select "Get" to install Ubuntu.


## Launch a distro
To complete the initialization of your newly installed distro, launch a new instance. You can do this by typing "ubuntu" in your Windows search bar 

![start](assets/start.png)

![start](assets/open_ubuntu.png)

The first time a newly installed distro runs, a Console window will open, and you'll be asked to wait for a minute or two for the installation to complete.

> During this final stage of installation, the distro's files are de-compressed and stored on your PC, ready for use. This may take around a minute or more depending on the performance of your PC's storage devices. This initial installation phase is only required when a distro is clean-installed - all future launches should take less than a second.

## Setting up a new Linux user account

Once installation is complete, you will be prompted to create a new user account (and its password).

This user account is for the normal non-admin user that you'll be logged-in as by default when launching a distro.

> You can choose any username and password you wish - they have no bearing on your Windows username. 

When you open a new distro instance, you won't be prompted for your password, but **if you elevate a process using `sudo`, you will need to enter your password**, so make sure you choose a password you can easily remember!

## Opening the WSL terminal

After that, whenever you want to use WSL, just type "ubuntu" in your Windows search bar 

![start](assets/start.png)

Open it:

![start](assets/open_ubuntu.png)

Then a terminal window will open that allows you to interact with Ubuntu.

then click "Properties"

Then under the "Options" tab, in the Edit Options section, make sure that "Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste" in enabled, then click "OK"

## Update & upgrade your distro's packages

Most distros ship with an empty/minimal package catalog. We strongly recommend regularly updating your package catalog, and upgrading your installed packages using your distro's preferred package manager. On Debian/Ubuntu, you use apt:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

> Windows does not automatically update or upgrade your Linux distro(s): This is a task that the Linux users prefer to control themselves.

## How to open Windows File Explorer to manipulate files inside WSL

If youâ€™d like to use Windows File Explorer to manipulate the files in WSL, just type this in the WSL terminal **(don't forget to include the dot! the dot means "current directory")**:

```console
mig@DESKTOP-GKLQ11P:~$ explorer.exe .
```
The Windows Explorer should pop up:

Keep in mind that you should manipulate files and create directories inside your `Ubuntu-18.04/home/<your name>` folder.

## You're all set!
