# SLU13 - Linear Algebra & NumPy, Part 2

In this unit you'll learn about matrix multiplication, determining the inverse, and how to use NumPy to perform those operations. You'll also learn about some NumPy methods which can be quite handy when you're summarizing and analyzing your data.

There are 2 optional sections, namely systems of linear equations and eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Although these are not required to pass the entrance exam, knowing about them is essential for virtually any data scientist.


# New concepts in this unit
- Matrix multiplication: understanding matrix multiplication, multiplication rules and application using NumPy;
- The inverse of a Matrix: intuitions on the matrix inverse and application using NumPy;
- Additional NumPy methods for the ndarray: min, max, sum and sort;
- Optional section - Systems of linear equations: Gauss-Jordan elimination and finding the inverse;
- Optional section - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
